Hi, I’m [@sparrow's](https://github.com/lingxz/sparrow) sister and my author made me compatible with NetlifyCMS. I am particularly great for a SEO-focused writer’s blog or personal webpage. I'm programmed to render your system font-stack and my performance grade is 94 on tools.pingdom.com.

This is a demo. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mighildotcom/sparrowx) and the documentation is available [on this page.](/documentation)

**Credits**
